## WHAT IS IT?

(a general understanding of what the model is trying to show or explain)

## HOW IT WORKS

(what rules the agents use to create the overall behavior of the model)

## HOW TO USE IT

(how to use the model, including a description of each of the items in the Interface tab)

## THINGS TO NOTICE

(suggested things for the user to notice while running the model)

## THINGS TO TRY

(suggested things for the user to try to do (move sliders, switches, etc.) with the model)

## EXTENDING THE MODEL

(suggested things to add or change in the Code tab to make the model more complicated, detailed, accurate, etc.)

## NETLOGO FEATURES

(interesting or unusual features of NetLogo that the model uses, particularly in the Code tab; or where workarounds were needed for missing features)

## RELATED MODELS

(models in the NetLogo Models Library and elsewhere which are of related interest)

## CREDITS AND REFERENCES

(a reference to the model's URL on the web if it has one, as well as any other necessary credits, citations, and links)
